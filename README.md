# Rondo: A Deep Learning Framework

*Rondo* is a Python-centric deep learning framework that offers automatic differentiation APIs rooted in the *define-by-run* methodology, also known as dynamic computational graphs. Additionally, it provides object-oriented high-level APIs for constructing and training neural networks. This project is deeply inspired by [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer) and is primarily for educational purposes, aimed at understaning the inner workings of such frameworks.
